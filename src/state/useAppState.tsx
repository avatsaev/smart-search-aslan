EntityState<T> shape looks like the following:

{
  ids: Array<number | string>,
  entities: { [id: number | string]: T},
}

- ids:
  is an array of IDs, used for sorting and ordering the records

- entities:
  is an un-ordered key-value Dictionary, allows fast lookup of records by their IDs,
  instead of iterating/filtering over an array of records
  it also has a lsit of ids which helps with sorting
